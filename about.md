This is a blog run by a group of friends (who also happen to be RSI 2025
[rickoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Science_Institute)).
We are interested in and write about a wide range of things:
- Goofy math stuff
- Yapping in spanish
- BBB
- Dolphin anatomy
- Inspirational quotes
- Breaking the record for number of rsi relationships (/hj)
- Life goals
- Tomfoolery

This is here for fun so try not to take anything 100% seriously, although
depending on context... im going to stop talking now. Posts are mostly
written by one or more members of the Dolphin Donglersâ„¢ but we might invite
special guests sometimes (imagine if feng zhang contributed to our blog
that would be epic)
