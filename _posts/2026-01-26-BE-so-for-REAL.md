When I was a kid (aka 2 years ago), I was like… *wow*, I want to be an online blogger just writing about my life. I was inspired by the college blogs I read before going into college. Well look at me now, here’s my dreams becoming a reality - not on a university blog but on Dolphin Donglers 🐬(I still don’t know why it’s called this). I think this is neat because some of you have NEVER even met me before, so all of this is your first impression of me - lit.

This is me.
<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; flex-wrap: nowrap; gap: 10px;">

</div>

This is a glamorous photo of me from just last night actually. My desktop was so dusty I had to wear a mask. I replaced the hard drive in my computer for the first time 🤯 with an upgraded 4TB HD because my other one had broken in the past semester. But before you start imagining and assuming that I’m a cs-major, you’re right. 

I was going to share a picture of me working on fixing my computer, but before I reveal my face, I’m going to have you play where is Waldo - except it has a slight twist. Where is *Erina*? Woah… But plot twist, even AI couldn’t spot me in the midst of many faces, so I’ll go ahead and make the game easy for you.

According to Graysen’s AI, Graysen and I are identical, so if you’re ever looking for me, look for a girl version of Graysen. If you’re looking for my sibling, Emily (my roommate) said, “You look like you could be Oliver’s older sister.” Next up: Erina looks like BingYi’s aunt’s second-cousin’s granddaughter (Don’t ask Bingyi about it).

Had \*some\* technical difficulties along the way to say the least, but fam we pulled through. “I’m happy to announce that Ubuntu is running on my computer that I fixed.” That definitely sounds LinkedIn core, so let me use this opportunity to pub my new linked in account. I mean, according to Oliver, you have to increase your connections to boost your huzz pool.

*Mmm.* 

*Thinking.* 

*Reasoning.* 

*Chunking.* 

*Spooling.*

Actually, don’t connect with me, let’s try to see if I can prove the reverse of Oliver’s theory to be true.

Now, I don’t want to finish my first blog ever without giving credit and love to whom credit is due: my GOATED roommate! The AMAZING person on the left is my roommate Emily! She gracefully dances, easily goes into the splits, passes Organic Chemistry with an A first semester at college (aka cracked), gives me like five staggered presents on my birthday, draws better than a printer, and even with all this skill she’s so sweet/thoughtful. I’m guessing your jaw dropped lower than my jaw in the earlier picture of me. Yes, this person is real. She’s so real that she’s in my Be Real.

Emily is on the left. I am on the right.

Also Featuring: Bingyi, Oliver, Simon, Adeline, and Chelsy

If you want to be featured next time, download BeReal and friend me @lightsshinebright!! Now, I want to test a different experiment. In high school, my friend said that his mom was a lawyer and that lawyers didn’t ever read the entire contract, negotiation paper, or official document. I was like NO WAY. Isn’t the whole point of being a lawyer to look at the nitpicky details of the long papers? In order to test this, his mom would put a line randomly in the paper that said something along the lines of “If you read this line, email me and I’ll give you xyz dollars.” Apparently, no one ever emailed her, so my classmate is convinced that lawyers don’t read entire documents. Now, this might entirely depend on what kind of lawyer you are or who your clients are. Anyways, I want to test this out too so I can see how many people actually read through everything I write. If you read this line, message me in discord and say “I’m a real one.” Now, I’ll just put in this filler sentence to make this paragraph seem longer and look like a normal paragraph.

I felt REALLY nauseous two weeks ago, and I told my research mentor about it when I came back. Then, he shared some of his wise opinions: “maybe you’re thinking too much.” Hear me out, his entire logic was that professors studying theoretical physics at MIT were probably more bald than other professors at MIT like Engineering professors because theoretical physicists thought a lot harder. Adamant to prove his point, he pulled up the MIT Theoretical physics faculty page, and we started scrolling through the profile pictures of professors - only focusing on their hair. Yeah… there was a decent amount without hair. Then, we pulled up the MechE professors. But low and behold, there was a comparable amount of hairless professors in both categories. I laughingly told him “I’m pretty sure all MIT professors think really hard.” Then, he had a bright idea… or a very interesting one. He opened a new tab and typed “Berklee College of Music Faculty.” Long story short, he deemed all the Berklee professors too young to be considered in our experiment . The experiment didn’t prove anything. So hopefully, you, the reader, have good genetics so that you still have hair when you’re old. Well, according to science, thinking harder could potentially lead to stress -> more bald. So take from this what you may.



Thank you for reading my blog. Hasta la vista.
