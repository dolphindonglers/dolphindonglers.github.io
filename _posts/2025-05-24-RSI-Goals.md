We all have very different goals for this summer, from learning cool science to making friends for the first time! /hj Here are some goals that will totally get realized at RSI:

> ***Iris*** I want to run consistently and dive deep into my research project!
<br><br>
> ***Rachel*** I want to learn more math, have meaningful conversations, and dump an ice bucket on Nishini! and there's another goal, for those who know
<br><br>
> ***Melis*** I want to form new connections with people outside of my comfort zone and explore my area of interest. Making more friends would be great :D
<br><br>
> ***Baddie hunter*** I want to make a bunch of new friends and learn a lot from them!
