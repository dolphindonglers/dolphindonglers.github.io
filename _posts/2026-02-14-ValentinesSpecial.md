Justin slid the white AirPods case out of his pocket. It bore the scars of its life. Key scratches. A mysterious dent. Evidence of previous battles. He poured isopropyl alcohol onto a Bounty paper towel and carefully wiped each AirPod, swiping along the thin rubber grille like he was prepping surgical instruments.

Sharing AirPods is a commitment. It’s a soft launch. A trial run of proximity. It says: I am willing to give you half my audio universe and trust that you will not play something unhinged.

Justin hoped. Quietly. Desperately. That by the end of the day, the universe would conspire to make this relevant.

Talking to a girl you like in a lecture class is structurally hostile to romance. There are no group discussions. No icebreakers. No convenient “turn to your neighbor” moments. Just rows. Silence. Slides. If you want to enter someone’s life, you have to leap across an aisle and announce yourself like a lunatic.

Justin did the math instead.

The professor taught from all four sides of the room, pacing like a restless particle trapped in a rectangular potential well. By the pigeonhole principle, Justin reasoned, at least one of those sides would eventually align his line of sight with hers. This was not optimism. This was combinatorics.

The professor kept writing. Lower. Lower. Justin’s eyes followed the chalk. And then the board ran out, and there she was.

She turned around.

Justin flinched like he had been caught cheating on a test administered by the universe. Their eyes met. She smiled, soft and unbothered, like this was a normal thing that happened to people. Justin smiled back with the intensity of someone trying not to drop a fragile object.

“Wanna work on today’s pset together?” she asked.

Justin’s brain bluescreened.

“Sure,” he said, sounding like a person who absolutely belonged in this moment.

Her past boyfriends had been tall. Effortlessly handsome. People who looked like they understood how mirrors worked. Justin was a nerd in the literal sense, a person whose confidence fluctuated with his GPA. He wondered, briefly and painfully, if this was a clerical error.

His mind wandered, traitorous.

He remembered sitting on the deck by the Potomac with someone else, months ago. Dawn creeping in. Both of them cold. His jacket heavy in his hands. The exact moment he could have given it to her. The exact moment he did not. A lifetime ago. A different version of himself. Cowardly in hindsight.

That night, he dreamed differently.

In the dream, he gave her the jacket. No hesitation. No internal debate. She smiled, the same smile from class, and the world felt aligned, like a solved system of equations. He woke up knowing something irreversible had occurred. He could not unknow her.

“And we’ll see how delta-epsilon becomes useful in Fourier series,” the professor said, voice snapping the room back into existence. “We’ll cover that next time. Class dismissed.”

Justin blinked.

Instead of her in his arms, there was his red pen. His lined paper. Notes clinging to the page like they had almost escaped. But she was still there, next to him, packing up her bag, real and unbothered by his internal saga.

This was the moment. The leap. No more probability. No more theory.

Justin stood, walked over, and said, “Hi.”

“Hi,” she said, smiling again, as if this was easy.

“Um,” Justin said, and then, committing fully, “do you want to work on the problem set tonight?”

The AirPods waited patiently in his pocket, freshly cleaned, ready for whatever universe decided next.
