The 18th floor of Green Building has always meant something to me.

**Pt. 1**

The year before RSI, I decided to seek out professors on my own at MIT. So I came to campus with nothing but audacity and a MacBook Air. I wandered into every building, getting hopelessly lost, then learning to find my way out. It was terrifying. It was exhilarating. It was exactly what I needed.
Mornings, I'd plant myself in the Nano Building's first-floor lounge, firing off emails while the sun was still low. Then the students would start flooding in, and I'd pack up and drift over to Green Building, just a short walk away. Green was different. Tall, central, unapologetically visible. It felt like a lighthouse for anyone trying to figure out where they were headed. I loved it there. The first two floors had this welcoming energy, and best of all, Green was the tallest building on campus. Sure, there's that new residence tower down in Kendall, but Green was central, accessible, and mine for the week. I claimed it as my workspace.

Lunch meant going vertical. My ears would pop somewhere around the 14th floor, and then I'd step out of those sleek new elevators and make my way to the 18th floor lounge. I'd set my computer down on one of the large desks while sunlight poured through those absurdly huge windows, casting long shadows across the room. 

Then I'd just... look. 

Cambridge sprawled beneath me. Vassar and CSAIL, dwarfed. The whole city, miniature and humming.

Dinner was trickier. I'd DoorDash Panda Express, except Green Building isn't accessible by road. So my orange chicken had to be delivered to the street outside Media Lab, and I'd trek over to retrieve it. Then back up to 18, where I'd eat while watching the sunset pull itself like a blanket over Cambridge, painting everything in reds, oranges, yellows, and purples so deep they looked borrowed from another world.
That night, I decided I was done for the day. I packed up, headed for the exit, pushed the door, and... nothing. It wouldn't budge. I was locked in.

*My heart dropped.*

Green has four doors though (not counting emergency stairs), so I tried another one. It opened. I have never been more relieved in my life. I had 911 ready to dial. That was the scariest moment of my entire week.

**Pt. II**

Days passed. I found myself wandering over to Vassar to hunt down Math and CS professors. I met with a few who were generous enough to show me around. I saw the robotics lab, the one that normally requires swipe access. On my way back to the elevator, I ran into Sophia and Carmen. We said hi. We took a selfie. They seemed so happy; I wanted that so badly the next summer.
But here's what I remember most clearly: sitting on the third floor couches, the building's open architecture letting sound travel freely, and hearing something drifting up from the first floor. A Rickoid, crying to his counselor about the stress of RSI.
*That's it*, I told myself. *This is my moment.* I was going to walk down there and ask for tips on getting into RSI. I was applying that fall. This was fate.

I turned the corner. And then I stopped. It wasn't the right time. It would be disrespectful. I could feel it. So I turned back.

I never saw their faces.

**Pt. 3**

The summer I returned to Cambridge for RSI, I hadn't forgotten Green.
A few days into the first week, curiosity overtook me. I pressed that shiny "18" button in the elevators I remembered from the year before. I walked the length of the hallway, turned right into the lounge, and at first all I could see was sky. Then, as I moved closer to the window, the city revealed itself inch by inch. I could almost smell the panda express I ate in there a year ago. Cambridge materialized below me, exactly as I remembered. Timeless. 

I took a photo and sent it to the counselor group chat.

Soon I started exploring more of Green. The auditorium became a favorite. I remember the bass of those speakers, the distant percussion of East Campus construction echoing through the walls as I worked, blasting Alan Walker. But paranoia crept in. The auditorium sits on its own floor, and barely anyone ever walked through, but I couldn't shake the feeling that someone would stroll in right as I was belting Britney Spears at volume.

I needed somewhere more private.

I searched and searched, and eventually I found it: a small room tucked behind a larger room and a kitchen. You had to pass through two sets of doors to reach it. Perfect. Even better, I could use the kitchen fridge to store my food and the microwave to heat it. I had discovered the cheat code to quick lunches. On Sundays, when TechCash reset, I'd load up on precooked meals from Brothers and stuff the mini-fridge full. Eventually the food got old, but for a while, I had the system beat.

I thought scarfing down lunch and rushing back to my experiments was the optimal play. In hindsight, I should have just gone to Brothers, to Stud, anywhere, to actually socialize. But I didn't know that then.

One more spot I have to mention: the 17th floor commons. Couches, games, and this large, plush massage-looking chair that sits right in front of the window with books tucked underneath. I never used it much during the summer, but in those final days, I brought a few friends up there after sunset. 

We took turns studying and sleeping, watching the lights of the city breathe below us.

**Pt. 4**

Green Building holds more memories than I could ever put into words. It represents hard work and hard play, working alone and working together. Cold emails and warm sunsets. Being locked in and finally feeling like I belonged.

And if I ever get the privilege to return to Cambridge, I know exactly where I'm going. I'll take that elevator up, walk to the window, and let two summers of memories flood through me as I watch the sunset sink past the horizon.

*Open the warm bowl of Panda Express*

Let the past rise with the steam, and leave a little space on the desk for whatever comes next.
