**“Lock in!”**

A voice ricochets down the hallway.

Humbug tells himself he will. He must. Lock in.

But the memory of her and the faint scent of something floral and soft, like blooming jasmine at dusk, unspools in his mind.

He can’t.

He can’t lock in.

Staring at the sterile glow of his computer screen, Humbug finds his fingers drifting—Ctrl+T, muscle memory stronger than discipline. Instagram. Discord. Again. And again. He watches the server like a silent pulse, waiting for a message, a flicker of life, a sign he’s not alone.

Outlook: empty.
The script runs: no error, no output.
Hope, like heat, dissipates.

It’s 1 a.m. now. To say he’s tired is a kindness. The hours after midnight pass in quicksilver—fast and slippery. Humbug reaches beneath his bed to the makeshift fridge he engineered from dorm scraps and pulls out a half-warm Celsius. He takes a sip, stands up, and steps out.
Because the real dreams happen beneath the open sky.

Outside, Boston’s night air wraps around him—sharp and alive.
His shirt billows, arms flapping like sails. The wind catches him and spins him forward, goosebumps rippling up his arms.
He likes it.
The sky above is no longer black. It breathes—turning violet, cobalt, emerald, wine.

Humbug walks, free.
And then—like a sudden ache—the thought of her returns.
The sky morphs. Her face, not the stars, fills the dark.
He imagines her walking beside him. Their hands intertwined—soft skin to soft skin. Her laugh tucked into the silence.
Across the bridge now, the Charles below mirroring the city above. He stumbles slightly over the crack where bridge meets road—where Cambridge becomes Boston. Behind him, skyscrapers fade into silhouettes. Ahead: small apartments with sleepy windows.

Humbug hesitates.
Should he say something? Tell her? Or stay quiet—preserve the daydream?

In his mind, she wears the Van Cleef bracelet. It clinks against the Patek on his wrist. He only bought it for her. Not to impress—but to match. To say: We’re on the same page. The same time.

But instead of heading back the way he came, Adi turns. He knows learning doesn’t happen in loops. It happens in **backpropagation**—errors traced, weights adjusted, meaning pulled from mistakes.

So he walks parallel to the river, westward—toward Harvard. Past joggers and lamps and the soft lull of water. He crosses again, this time into the narrow, golden-lit streets of Lowell, past the ivory tower of Winthrop.

Eventually, Humbug returns to Maseeh. His hands are cold. His thoughts are clear.
Improvement.

He falls into bed—and keeps falling.
Through the dream. Through the air.

And then—
He's awake.
She’s there.
Next to him.

Maybe tomorrow he’ll say something. But tonight, he just dreams.
