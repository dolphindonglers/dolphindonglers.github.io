I went to see marty supreme and it was really good.

I dont know whether I should admire/emulate his outlook on life or be afraid of it

"and what if you fail?"

"That doesn't even enter my conciousness."

am I supposed to be a marty? is being safe being lame? am i doing the world a disservice if not putting my entire being into one purpose
